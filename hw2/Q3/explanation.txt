3.a.2. Plasma glucose and insulin should work better at classification because of less overlaping of positive and negative cases compared to the feature combination of BMI and blood pressure.

3.c. Log scaling helps reduce the variability along the scaled axis and can be used in cases where the range of data along the axis has a greater spread.
While the square root scaling can also help reduce the variability in a limited way, it is more effective in cases where we are trying to scale data which could be a product of two one-dimensional data.
